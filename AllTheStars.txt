<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br>
Love, let's talk about love<br>
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br>
Or do the feeling haunt you?<br>
I know the feeling haunt you<br>
<br>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
<br>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br>
Tell me what you gon' do to me<br>
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me<br>
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue<br>
But you can't bring the truth to me<br>
Fuck you and all your expectations<br>
I don't even want your congratulations<br>
I recognize your false confidence<br>
And calculated promises all in your conversation<br>
I hate people that feel entitled<br>
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you<br>
Oh, you important?<br>
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?<br>
Motherfucker, I don't even like you<br>
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift<br>
That's how you find out who you dealin' with<br>
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with<br>
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'<br>
On my momma, that's the realest shit<br>
<br>
Love, let's talk about love<br>
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br>
Or do the feeling haunt you?<br>
I know the feeling haunt you<br>
<br>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
<br>
Skin covered in ego<br>
Get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound<br>
Got no end game, got no reason<br>
Got to stay down, it's the way that you making me feel<br>
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do<br>
You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me<br>
If you do, I won't move<br>
I ain't just cryin' for no reason<br>
I ain't just prayin' for no reason<br>
I give thanks for the days, for the hours<br>
And another way, another life breathin'<br>
I did it all 'cause it feel good<br>
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad<br>
Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time<br>
<br>

All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
